# HTDA Framework – Core

Core provides minimal, stable building blocks used by most HTDA modules.

## Scope
- Logging facade (pluggable sink)
- Result primitives
- Guard validation
- Minimal lifecycle contracts
- Small type-based event bus

## Design Rules
- Keep Core small and stable
- Avoid feature creep
- Editor-only utilities belong to Tier 2
- Patterns/Utilities belong to Tier 1
